**RandBar - Random Dynamics of a Bar System** is an easy-to-run code to simulate the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of a bar structural system with attached discrete elements. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive.

## Software History

This code was developed to conduct stochastic simulations of a bar structural system with with attached discrete elements. The underlying results are reported in the following paper:
- *A. Cunha Jr, R. Sampaio, On the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of a continuous system with discrete attached elements, Applied Mathematical Modelling, v. 39, pp. 809-819, 2015 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2014.07.012*

## Documentation

**RandBar** routines are commented in order to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description about its purpose, and a list of inputs and/or outputs.
